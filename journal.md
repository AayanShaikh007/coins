Today I spent my time deciding what project I wanted to make that fits within the theme of currency or coins. As a first year student in university, I quickly realized that there are so many expenses that we make on a daily basis, and it is important to keep track of these expenses to see any trends and keep spending in check. Considering how problematic student debt is in the U.S. and Canada, keeping a budget seems to be an essential for every student.

The Project:  
I decided to make a terminal based budget tracking app, tailored towards students. It will allow you to record your expenses and categorize them, or see trends in spending habits. 


Functionalities:
- Data will be saved to the local drive to make the app more practical to use. 
- Data Record Mode: allows for new expenses to be recorded, keeping track of date, category, and necessity. 
- Data View Mode: reveals information about the expenses over the past (month?), and giving suggestions to reduce spending (ex. you spent a total of $120 on restaurants, meal prep will save you (x) dollars per month)
- On program startup, there will also be a short dialogue about spending habits prompting user to enter Data view mode.   

**List is Subject to change**

Today I started making the Data Record functionality, I will work on data saving once I have a proof of concept of the data record functionality.
